## Description
It does what the original [ASF-STM (by Rudokhvist)](https://github.com/Rudokhvist/ASF-STM) script does with some extra features.

## Development
Run the unit tests (Node.js only, no dependencies):

```
node --test test/*.test.js
```

Build both distributables (`dist/ASF-STM.user.js` and `dist/ASF-STM.debug.js`):

```
python script/build.py
```

## Added features
- Invenotry scan: scan your inventory in only 10\* seconds!
- Friend match: match with your public-inventory friends (friends-only/private inventories will mark the badges as private).
- Scan filters: you don't want to scan the badges every time? add some filters and reduce your scan time considerably!
- Updated UI for better UX: buttons are now clickable (not just the text), nickname sanitization, scrollable menus, link to trade partener's badge.
- **DEV** Templates: now it's easier to work on those JavaScript template strings containing HTML or CSS.
- **DEV** Build tool: script is automatically compiled, templates are minified and version bump triggers the release workflow.
- **DEV** Automatic releases: every version bump a draft release will be generated for convenience.
